# Above the Clouds

This is the Above the Clouds proof of concept. It is a top-down 2D game built with Raylib in C. The player controls Z, a young woman living in a sunken desert village in a post-climate-collapse world. The village is known and the corporate city is visible and accessible via visitor tokens. The gameplay loop is: scavenge components in the desert, repair them at a workbench, trade surplus for visitor tokens, use tokens at the corporate city gate to buy data logs and upgrades, and talk to a citizen companion powered by the Claude API. The mystery is not the city — it's what's beyond the clouds. Small inconsistencies accumulate over time until Z realizes the world is much bigger than anyone believes.
